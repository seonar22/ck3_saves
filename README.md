# Purpose
For logging gameplays as tiny AAR.

## Setup
- if there will be mod used, it will be stated.
- game version will be put per each entry
- won't be doing ironman, as game is buggy as if an unfinished product. PDX has gone downhill, yet making money due to blind devotion of some fans throw cash and filling up stockholder. 

## List of characters
1. [Ngapo Ap Hang, Daramdin, 867](img/1_Hang.png), v 1.15, all DLCs, no mod | [savefile](saves/1_Hang.ck3)
    * intent: reform Kiratism, and stay independant
    * tiny AAR:  a conundrum, fundamentalist attitude, while keeping Eastern Syncretism.  The land covered by the newly formed Empire has more than one pagan religions, while Eastern religion followers, inside and surrounding the Empire, are still holding ... ambitions and grudges alike. 
    * inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8o4K0wDcc0)
    * should take more time in doing tasks, like reforming religion or cultural stuffs.
1. [Meayge, El-Fasher, 1066](img/2_Meayge.png), v 1.15, all DLCs, no mod | [savefile](saves/2_Meayge.ck3)
    * intent: reform Kushite, and spread in its heartland, then along the Nile and beyond.
    * tiny AAR: overtook Nubia, reform Kushite and spread to its former lands of Apedemak. Not bad for getting it in one's lifetime, especially with character started with age 43.
    * inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft9EQaIPGek)
    * same as playing for beta Iseral, but instead for Kushite. And didn't know you can be Spiritual HoF, while keeping Lay Clergy, thus can own temple holdings.
1. [Ubbe, Jorvik/York, 867](img/3_ubbe.png), v 1.15, all DLCs, no mod | [savefile](saves/3_ubbe.ck3)
    * intent: to play as similar route in koifish video 
    * tiny AAR: at this point, at crossroad, as can settle at Estate, conquer kingdom or continue as mercenary
    * inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mhy0nUNc7Ys)
    * lesson learnt: if playing as adventure, should have worked a bit into getting knight and army beforehand. Well, what to expect from "Content creator". /s
1. [Huaishen, Guiyi, 867](img/5_guiyi.png), v 1.15, all DLCs, no mod | [savefile](saves/5_guiyi.ck3)
    * intent: to make Guiyi last, if possible De jure
    * tiny AAR: quite a fun play, when you beat the shit out of the game
1. [Sharaf al-Dawla Muslim, Uqalid Emirate, 1066](img/4_TwoRiver.png), v 1.15, all DLCs, no mod | [savefile](saves/4_TwoRiver.ck3)
    * intent: to test out new formable Beth Nahrain Titular Empire
    * tiny AAR: Could double down on Hindustan, if not forming own cult.
1. [Temujin, Ogrash, 1178](img/6_temu.png), v 1.16, all DLCs, no mod | [savefile](saves/6_temu.ck3) | reduced adventures to 25 as game is lagging already
    * intent: to get "The Stallion that Mounts the World""
    * tiny AAR: Most micro intensive gameplay. No, I don't get that conqueror event usually happen around 1200.
    * nomadic gov is a fun one to play. Not sure if can be mixed with adventure type characters.
    * rest of events noteworthy in [this folder](img/6_temu)

## Planned to play
1. [Uniting Slavs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzXxmtcrrA0)
    * koifish is quite overly dramatic, maybe trait of brits or similar. Time for Bruce, and instead of custom character, I prefer to play as Mutimir of Raska.
1. ~~Guiyi Kingdom~~
    * ~~only severely nerfed Tang remnant  in the game. Even Xi Xia is De Jure for dukedom and counties. And Zhang members are quite capable members, historically. Even with coming barbarian update, this area and character won’t get proper setting like in History. Well, it will be a nice one to play out.~~
1. Jamukha, Khentil, 1178
    * Chief rival of Genghis Khan. One of best characters to try alt history.
1. Bilge, Naiman, 1178
    * Same situation as Jamukha, but with little time left. Would be a feat, if can pull Greatest of Khan in one lifetime
1. Gartizia Enekez, Navarra, 867
    * Sancho Garcés is not born yet. so no contemporary play. Still will be an interesting, if not to be following historical records. Basque in Glory
